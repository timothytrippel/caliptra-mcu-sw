# DOT I3C Recovery Protocol

This document specifies the I3C-based transport protocol used for Device Ownership Transfer (DOT) recovery in the MCU ROM or runtime. For the overall DOT specification, see [Device Ownership Transfer](dot.md). For the general I3C services framework and framing, see [ROM I3C Services](rom_i3c_services.md).

## Overview

When the MCU ROM detects a corrupted or missing DOT blob while in ODD state (Locked or Disabled), the device enters DOT recovery mode via the ROM's I3C services handler (with `I3cServicesModes::DOT_RECOVERY` enabled). In this mode, the ROM waits for an external recovery agent to send a backup DOT blob over I3C.

### Recovery Trigger Conditions

DOT I3C recovery is entered when **any** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Empty/erased DOT blob with DOT enabled**: The DOT blob in flash is all zeros or all 0xFF, but the `DOT_INITIALIZED` fuse is set, indicating the device expects a valid DOT blob.
2. **Corrupt DOT blob in locked state**: The DOT blob exists in flash but fails HMAC authentication using the DOT_EFFECTIVE_KEY, and the DOT_FUSE_ARRAY is in ODD state (locked).
3. **Both A/B copies invalid**: If the device stores redundant DOT blob copies (A/B partitions) and both copies are missing or fail authentication, recovery is triggered.

### `DOT_RECOVERY` Flow

    Note over MCU: Boots, detects corrupt DOT blob
    MCU->>BMC: IBI (MDB=0x1F) payload: [0x80] (1 byte payload + 1 byte MDB)

    opt BMC checks status
        BMC->>MCU: DOT_STATUS query (private write)
        MCU->>BMC: DOT_STATUS response: [status = 0x80] (1 byte, private read)
    end

    BMC->>MCU: DOT_RECOVERY + blob (XYZ bytes, private write)
    MCU->>BMC: DOT_RECOVERY response: [status] (1 byte, private read)

    Note over MCU: Writes blob to flash, resets
```

## I3C Transport Details

### MDB (Mandatory Data Byte)

| MDB  | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0x1F | DOT recovery IBI with inline payload data |

MDB 0x1F is a vendor-defined value. The IBI carries inline payload data (status byte).

### Framing

Commands and responses are carried over I3C private writes and private reads respectively.

#### BMC → MCU (Private Write)

```
Byte 0:  Command ID (u8)
Byte 1:  Length (u8)
Byte 2:  Sequence number
Byte 3:  Total sequences
Bytes 4+:  Payload (variable length, determined by length)
```

Since messages can in general be more than the MTU for I3C, a simple sequencing system is used.

The sequence number is a 1-up counter, and the third byte indicates the total number of sequences.

#### MCU → BMC (Private Read)

All MCU responses are sent as a sequence private reads. The lengths will always be known in advance by the recovery agent, as only simple responses are used by this protocol.

**DOT_RECOVERY_RESPONSE** (success response to DOT_RECOVERY):

```
Byte 0: Status code (u8) = 0x00
```

### Commands

| Cmd ID | Name | Payload | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| 0x01 | DOT_STATUS | (none) | BMC queries current DOT recovery status |
| 0x02 | DOT_RECOVERY | ... | BMC sends a backup DOT blob for recovery |
| 0x03 | DOT_UNLOCK_CHALLENGE | ... | BMC sends starts override sequence |
| 0x04 | DOT_OVERRIDE | ... | BMC sends continues override sequence |
