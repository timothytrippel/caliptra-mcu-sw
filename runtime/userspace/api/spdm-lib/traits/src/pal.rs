//! Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) for the SPDM-Lite stack.
//!
//! This module defines the [`SpdmPal`] trait, which acts as the top-level
//! abstraction that platform-specific implementations must satisfy. It
//! composes the required transport capabilities (via [`SpdmIoTransport`])
//! into a single trait bound, making it the primary integration point for
//! platform or transport implementations.

/// SPDM-Lite stack: per-I/O allocation, transport I/O, hashing, certificate
/// access, measurement retrieval, persistent large-message storage for
/// chunking, and secure-session cryptographic operations.
