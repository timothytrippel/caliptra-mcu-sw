//! Low-level asynchronous transport trait used by the SPDM-Lite PAL.
//!
//! This module defines [`PalTransport`], an `async` byte-oriented interface
//! that platform implementations expose to the SPDM-Lite stack. Unlike the
//! higher-level [`SpdmIoTransport`](crate::SpdmIoTransport), which operates
//! on framed [`SpdmIo`](crate::SpdmIo) objects, `PalTransport` works
//! directly on raw byte buffers and is intended to wrap an underlying
//! transport (e.g., MCTP, PCIe DOE, I3C) at the PAL layer.
//!
//! Implementations also indicate whether the transport supports SPDM
//! Secured Messages and convey per-message security framing on each
//! exchange.

/// raw SPDM byte streams with a remote endpoint. The trait is `async`,
/// allowing implementations to suspend execution while waiting on I/O,
/// and includes a capability query plus a per-message "secured" flag so
/// the stack can distinguish plain SPDM messages from SPDM Secured
/// Messages on the wire.
