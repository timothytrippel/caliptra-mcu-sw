//! Running-hash abstraction used by the SPDM-Lite stack.
//!
//! Each backend defines its own [`SpdmPalHash::State`] type — the
//! 200-byte Caliptra mailbox context, a `sha2::Sha384` instance,
//! a test mock with arbitrary fields, etc. Containers that hold
//! hash state (the transcript manager, future signing flows) are
//! generic over `State`, never tied to a particular backend.
//!
//! # Why `&impl SpdmPalIo` on every call?
//!
//! Backends that need per-IO scratch (the Caliptra mailbox impl
//! allocates a 64-byte command buffer per call) use the
//! [`SpdmPalIo`] handle to scope those allocations to the
//! currently-in-flight SPDM exchange. Software backends ignore
//! the `io` argument entirely.
//!
//! # Fallible clone on `State`
//!
//! [`SpdmPalHash::hash_clone`] lets the transcript manager fork a
//! running hash and continue both branches independently — e.g.
//! `M1 = VCA.fork().extend(B).extend(C)` per SPDM The
//! operation is fallible because some backends allocate heap storage
//! for running hash contexts.
